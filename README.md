# Weather App

Welcome to the **Weather App** repository! This project showcases a simple and interactive weather application developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This app demonstrates my front-end development skills and the ability to fetch and display dynamic data using APIs.

## Project Description

The Weather App allows users to:
- Search for the current weather of any city.
- View key weather details such as temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.
- Enjoy a responsive and user-friendly design.
